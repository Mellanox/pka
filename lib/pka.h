/// This file forms an interface to the BlueField PK Accelerator based
/// on EIP-154.   The API is referred to  as "northbound interface" for
/// communication between user application and PKA hardware Rings.
///
/// The PKA hardware makes available a number of basic arithmetic (e.g.,
/// add and multiply) and complex arithmetic (e.g., modular exponentiation
/// and modular inversion) as well as high-level operations such as RSA,
/// Diffie-Hellman, Elliptic Curve Cryptography, and the Federal Digital
/// Signature Algorithm (DSA as documented in FIPS 186) public-private key
/// systems.
///
/// The API consists of an interface which allows user applications to
/// accelerate PK operations. The API allows user application to open and
/// release a PK instance. A PK instance refers to an execution context,
/// i.e. parameters and hardware configuration which allows to process PK
/// operations. It then encapsulates the PK global information structure.
///
/// @note Almost all functions are asynchronous and require a 'handle'
/// argument to be passed to them. Typically, a 'handle' encapsulates
/// all the parameters, status of an execution context of a given user
/// application.
///
/// @note An application running multiple threads has as many handles
/// as threads.
///
/// For example to use this module to do a single RSA encryption, one could
/// do the following:
///
/// @code
/// // 64-bit RSA encryption example.
/// //

/// This file describes a memory management interface used by rings to allocate
/// free memory needed by PK commands.
///
/// PKA memory allocator's job is primarily to manage the data memory - i.e.
/// efficiently allocate and free memory space to hold the input/output vectors.
/// One could use this code to do individual allocations and frees for each
/// vector, but instead it is expected that a single contiguous allocation/free
/// will be done for all the vectors - i.e. operands and results, belonging to
/// a single command. It is possible to also support a mode of operation,
/// whereby individual operand allocation can be used when a single command
/// allocation fails for lack of memory (i.e. this can deal efficiently with
/// the occasional data memory fragmentation where there is enough contiguous
/// memory pieces to hold the individual operand, but not single piece large
/// enough to hold all of the operands).
///
/// This code assumes that Data Memory is in the bottom 14KB of the "PKA window
/// RAM" and so the addresses for the rings start at offset 0x3800.  Also, note
/// that just because the rings hold 16 descriptors, does not mean that 16
/// commands can be outstanding - since it is expected that often the Data
/// Memory will run out before any or all of the rings are full themselves.
/// Of course the opposite can also happen (though less likely) - that is the
/// rings are full, when the Data Memory is not!
///
/// Note also that ALL allocations handled by this code start at least on
/// 64-byte boundaries and ALL allocations have sizes that are a multiple of
/// 64 bytes. The algorithm here always maximally coalesces contiguous free
/// space. In other words, there is never a case where two free space descri-
/// -ptors point to adjacent memory. Of course the converse is not true. Used
/// space blocks can be adjacent to either other used space blocks to free space
/// blocks.
///
/// Valid free space descriptors (i.e. those whose size is not zero) are kept on
/// various lists based upon their size.  Non-valid free space descriptors (so
/// called "free" avail space descriptors) are linked on a single free list.

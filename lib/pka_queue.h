/// API to manage software queues. It consists of an implementation of circular
/// queues on top of command/result descriptor rings. It allows multiple threads
/// to submit PK commands to the hardware without causing ring congestion.
/// Software-based queues are assigned to clients which may run over single or
/// multiple threads, a pair of queue per thread: one queue to append command
/// descriptors and an other one to append result descriptors. Each group of
/// queues is associated to a one or group of rings depending on client context.
/// The implementation of the software-based queues help to leverage the small
/// size of descriptor rings and avoid interrupts, so far (processes have to
/// wait until a given ring can accept new descriptors again).
/// Queues have the following properties :
///      - FIFO,
///      - Capacity is fixed,
///      - Lockless implementation,
/// However, having many circular queues with significant size may costs in
/// terms of memory (more than linked list queue).  An empty queue contains
/// at least N pointers.
///
/// Note that the current API implements an Enq/Deq a fixed number of items
/// from a queue and does not support multi producer/consumer.
///
/// Also note that the implementation includes a mechanism which exert a back
/// pressure to inform a given client to pause. It defines a threshold, once
/// an enqueue reaches the high threshold, the client is notified.
